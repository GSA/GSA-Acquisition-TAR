         <p class="p P">1. Use the same basic instructions for the SF 1035 as used for the SF 1034. Ensure that the contract and, if applicable, order number, are shown on each continuation sheet. Use as many sheets as necessary to show the information required by the contract, contracting officer, or responsible audit agency; however, if more than one sheet of SF 1035 is used, each sheet shall be in numerical sequence.
</p>
         <p class="p P">2. The following items are generally entered below the line with Number and Date of Order; Date of Delivery or Service; Articles or Services; Quantity; Unit Price; and Amount (but do not necessarily tie to these captions).

</p>
         <p class="p P">a. Show, as applicable, the target or estimated costs, target or fixed-fee, and total contract value, as adjusted by any modifications to the contract or order.

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(3) <em class="ph i">Fringe Benefits.</em> If fringe benefits are included in the overhead pool, no entry is required. If the contract allows for a separate fringe benefit pool, cite the formula (rate and base) in effect during the time the costs were incurred.

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(4) <em class="ph i">Materials, Supplies, Equipment.</em> Show those items normally treated as direct costs. Expendable items need not be itemized and may be grouped into major classifications such as office supplies.
