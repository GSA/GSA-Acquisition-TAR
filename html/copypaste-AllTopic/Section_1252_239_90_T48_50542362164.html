         <p class="p P">As prescribed in 1239.7303(b), insert the following clause:
</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">Technology Upgrades/Refreshment (NOV 2022)
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Upgrade/refreshment approach.</em> After issuance of the contract, the Government may solicit, and the Contractor is encouraged to propose independently, technology improvements to the hardware, software, specifications, or other requirements of the contract. These improvements may be proposed to save money, to improve performance, to save energy, to satisfy increased data processing requirements, or for any other purpose that presents a technological advantage to the Government. As part of the proposed changes, the Contractor shall submit a price or cost proposal to the Contracting Officer for evaluation. Those proposed technology improvements that are acceptable to the Government will be processed as modifications to the contract. As a minimum, the following information shall be submitted by the Contractor with each proposal:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) A description of the difference between the existing contract requirement and the proposed change, and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) Itemized requirements of the contract that must be changed if the proposal is adopted, and the proposed revision to the contract for each such change;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) An estimate of the changes in performance and price or cost, if any, that will result from adoption of the proposal;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) An evaluation of the effects the proposed changes would have on collateral costs to the Government, such as Government-furnished property costs, costs of related items, and costs of maintenance, operation and conversion (including Government application software);
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) A statement of the time by which the contract modification adopting the proposal must be issued so as to obtain the maximum benefits of the changes during the remainder of the contract including supporting rationale; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(6) Identification of any impacts to contract completion time or delivery schedule. The Government is not liable for proposal preparation costs or for any delay in acting upon any proposal submitted pursuant to this clause. The Contractor has a right to withdraw, in whole or in part, any proposal not adopted by contract modification within the period specified in the proposal. The decision of the Contracting Officer whether to accept any such proposal under this contract is final and not subject to the “Disputes” clause of this contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Test and evaluation.</em> If the Government wishes to test and evaluate any item(s) proposed, the Contracting Officer will issue written directions to the Contractor specifying what item(s) will be tested, where and when the item(s) will be tested, to whom the item(s) is to be delivered, and the number of days (not to exceed 90 calendar days) that the item will be tested. The Contracting Officer may accept any proposal submitted pursuant to this clause by giving the Contractor written notice thereof. This written notice will be given by issuance of a modification to the contract. Unless and until a modification is executed to incorporate a proposal under this contract, the Contractor shall remain obligated to perform in accordance with the requirements, terms and conditions of the existing contract. If a proposal submitted pursuant to this clause is accepted and applied to this contract, the equitable adjustment increasing or decreasing the price or CPFF shall be in accordance with the procedures of the applicable “Changes” clause incorporated by reference in Section I of the contract. The resulting contract modification will state that it is made pursuant to this clause.</p>
