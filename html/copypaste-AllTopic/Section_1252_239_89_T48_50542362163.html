         <p class="p P">As prescribed in 1239.7303(a), insert the following clause:
</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">Technology Modernization (NOV 2022)
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Modernization approach.</em> After issuance of the contract, the Government may solicit, and the Contractor is encouraged to propose independently, a modernization approach to the hardware, software, specifications, or other requirements of the contract. This modernization approach may be proposed to increase efficiencies (both system and process level), reduce costs, or strengthen the cyber security posture, or for any other purpose which presents an advantage to the Government. Furthermore, the modernization approach should, to the maximum extent practicable, align with how the commercial sector would solve the problem.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Proposal requirements.</em> As part of the proposed changes, the Contractor shall submit a price or cost proposal to the Contracting Officer for evaluation. Those proposed modernized improvements that are acceptable to the Government will be processed as modifications to the contract. At a minimum, the Contractor shall submit the following information with each proposal:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) A summary of how the modernized proposal aligns with the commercial sector approach and how the current approach is out of alignment/differs;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) A description of the difference between the existing contract requirement and the proposed change, and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Itemized requirements of the contract that must be changed if the proposal is adopted and the proposed revision to the contract for each such change;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) An estimate of the changes in performance and price or cost, if any, that will result from adoption of the proposal;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) An evaluation of the effects the proposed changes would have on collateral costs to the Government, such as Government-furnished property costs, costs of related items, and costs of maintenance, operation and conversion (including Government application software);
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(6) A statement of the schedule for contract modification adopting the proposal that maximizes benefits of the changes during the remainder of the contract, including supporting rationale; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(7) Identification of impacts on contract cost and schedule. The Government is not liable for proposal preparation costs or for any delay in acting upon any proposal submitted pursuant to this clause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Withdrawal.</em> The Contractor has a right to withdraw, in whole or in part, any proposal not adopted by contract modification within the period specified in the proposal. The decision of the Contracting Officer whether to accept any such proposal under this contract is final and not subject to the “Disputes” clause of this contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Product testing.</em> If the Government wishes to test and evaluate any item(s) proposed, the Contracting Officer will issue written directions to the Contractor specifying what item(s) will be tested, where and when the item(s) will be tested, to whom the item(s) is to be delivered, and the number of days (not to exceed 90 calendar days) that the item will be tested.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Contract modification.</em> The Contracting Officer may accept any proposal submitted pursuant to this clause by giving the Contractor written notice thereof. This written notice will be given by issuance of a modification to the contract. Until the Government issues a modification incorporating a proposal under this contract, the Contractor shall remain obligated to perform in accordance with the requirements, terms, and conditions of the existing contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Change orders.</em> If a proposal submitted pursuant to this clause is accepted and applied to this contract, the equitable adjustment increasing or decreasing the price or cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) shall be in accordance with the procedures of the applicable “Changes” clause incorporated by reference in the contract. The resulting contract modification will state that it is made pursuant to this clause.</p>
