				     </p>

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Separation of phases.</em> DOT organizations and research organizations must ensure the separation of the Inquiry, Investigation and Determination Phases of this process.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) In general, DOT organizations must strive to protect the interests of the Federal Government and the public in carrying out this process.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) There must be a significant departure from the accepted practices of the relevant research community;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The misconduct must have been committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; and

                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The allegation must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">DOT Oversight Organization Investigation.</em> The DOT oversight organization may proceed with its own investigation at any time if:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) DOT determines the research institution is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this policy.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) DOT involvement is needed to protect the public interest, including public health and safety.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The allegation involves an entity of sufficiently small size (or an individual) that it cannot sufficiently conduct the investigation itself.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) The DOT oversight organization may take, or cause to be taken, interim administrative actions (including special certifications, assurances, or other administrative actions) when deemed appropriate to protect the welfare of human and animal subjects of research, prevent inappropriate use of Federal funds, or otherwise protect the public interest and safety.
</p>

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Activity sanctions or corrective actions.</em> Upon receipt of the investigative reports from the contractor, the DOT oversight organization, in conjunction with the Contracting Officer, will review the report, and determine the appropriate administrative action to be taken. In deciding what actions to take, the oversight organizations should consider: the severity of the misconduct; the degree to which the misconduct was knowing, intentional, or reckless; and whether it was an isolated event or part of a pattern. Sanctions or corrective actions may range as follows - 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Minimal restrictions</em> - such as a letter of reprimand, additional conditions on awards, requiring third-party certification of accuracy or compliance with particular policies, regulations, guidelines, or special terms and conditions;

                                 <p class="p List2">(2) In all other cases, the Contractor may appeal the sanction or corrective action through the DOT Research and Technology Coordinating Council (RTCC) to the Deputy Secretary of Transportation, in writing within 30 calendar days after receiving written notification of the research misconduct finding and associated administrative action(s). The Contractor shall mail a copy of the appeal to the Contracting Officer.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) If there is no request for appeal within 30 calendar days, the administrative actions of the oversight organization shall be final.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) If a request for appeal is received by the RTCC within the 30-calendar day limit, the Deputy Secretary may have the RTCC review the appeal and make recommendations.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) The RTCC on behalf of the Deputy Secretary will normally inform the appellant of the final decision on an appeal within 60 calendar days of receipt. This decision will then be the final DOT administrative action.

If criminal or civil fraud violations may have occurred, the oversight organization should promptly refer the matter to the DOT Inspector General, the Department of Justice or other appropriate investigative body. The DOT oversight organization, in conjunction with the Contracting Officer will notify the respondent in writing of its action, sanctions to be imposed if applicable, and the DOT appeal procedures.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Subcontract flowdown.</em> The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts that involve research.</p>
