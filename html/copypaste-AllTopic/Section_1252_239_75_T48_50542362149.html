</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, DOT implementing regulations (49 CFR part 10), and DOT policies issued under the Act in the design, development, and/or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish a DOT function when the contract specifically identifies the work that the Contractor is to perform.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, and/or operation of a system of records on individuals that is subject to the Act; and

This obligation is in addition to any limitations of subcontracting and consent to subcontract requirements identified elsewhere in the clauses and provisions of this contract.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Certify in writing, upon completion of services provided by a subcontractor, that the subcontractor has returned to the Contractor all records containing PII within 30 days of subcontractor's completion of services to Contractor. Failure of subcontractor to return all records containing PII within this period will be reported to DOT as a privacy incident; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Report breaches involving PII directly to DOT at (202) 385–4357 or 1-(866)-466–5221 within two (2) hours of discovery.
