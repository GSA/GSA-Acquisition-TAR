</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) All Information and Communication Technology (ICT) supplies, information, documentation and services support developed, acquired, maintained or delivered under this contract or order must comply with the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Standards and Guidelines (<em class="ph i">see</em> 36 CFR parts 1193 and 1194).

In those cases, the Contractor may be required to provide a completed Section 508 Checklist and any other additional information necessary to assist the Government in determining that the ICT supplies or services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards.
