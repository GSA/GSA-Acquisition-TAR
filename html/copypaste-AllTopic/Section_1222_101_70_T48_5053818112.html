         <p class="p List1">(a) It is DOT policy to admit labor union representatives of contractor employees to DOT installations to visit work sites and transact labor union business with contractors, their employees, or union stewards pursuant to existing union collective bargaining agreements. Their presence shall not interfere with the contractor's work progress under a DOT contract, nor violate the safety or security regulations that may be applicable to persons visiting the installation. The union representatives will not be permitted to conduct meetings, collect union dues, or make speeches concerning union matters while visiting a work site.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Whenever a union representative is denied entry to a work site, the person denying entry shall make a written report to the labor advisor for the applicable Operating Administration or to the DOT labor coordinator, the Office of the General Counsel, Office of General Law, within the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, within two working days after the request for entry is denied. The report shall include the reason(s) for the denial, the name of the representative denied entry, the union affiliation and number, and the name and title of the person that denied the entry.
