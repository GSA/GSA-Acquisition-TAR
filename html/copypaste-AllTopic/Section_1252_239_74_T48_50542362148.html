</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) The Contractor will apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan, as required by, clause 1252.239–70, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources.
