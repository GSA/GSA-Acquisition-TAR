         <p class="p List2">(1) Actions must be appealed within 30 days of receipt of the written statement required by (FAR) 48 CFR 27.304-5(a). The contractor must present all pertinent arguments in the appeal along with documentary evidence, if any.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The HCA may hold an informal hearing if deemed appropriate or at the request of the contractor. The informal hearing shall be held after all fact-finding is completed.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) If a hearing is held, there shall be a transcribed record of the same. A copy of the transcript shall be available to the contractor at cost.

</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A copy of the findings of fact shall be sent to the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) by registered or certified mail. The contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) and agency representatives will be given 30 days to submit written arguments to the HCA; and, upon request by the contractor oral arguments will be held before the HCA as part of an informal hearing. The HCA will make the final determination as to whether the initial agency action was appropriate under the relevant laws and procedures (<em class="ph i">See</em> 1227.304-5(c)(4)).

The HCA shall provide the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) a written determination by certified or registered mail no later than 90 days after fact-finding is completed or no later than 90 days after oral arguments, whichever is later.
