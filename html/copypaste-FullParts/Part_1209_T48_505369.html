The contractor (and any specifically named affiliates) are provided an opportunity to submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Notice of proposal to debar.</em> DOT shall send the notice of proposed debarment to the last known address of the individual or contractor, the individual or contractor's counsel, or agent for service of process, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or any other means that allows for confirmation of delivery to include by mail, to the last known street address, to the last known facsimile numbers, or to the last known email address. In the case of a contractor, DOT may send the notice of proposed debarment to the contractor, any partner, principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture; to the contractor's identified counsel for purposes of administrative proceedings; or to the contractor's agent for the service of process. If sent by email, it shall be sent to the last known email addresses for all three, if known. Additionally, for each specifically named affiliate, the notice shall be sent to the affiliate itself, the affiliate's identified counsel for purposes of the administrative proceedings, or the affiliate's agency for service of process.

			If DOT does not receive a reply from the contractor within 30 calendar days after sending the notice of proposed debarment, the SDC shall prepare a recommendation in conjunction with the cognizant contracting officer, and refer the case to the SDO for a decision on whether to debar based on the information available. If DOT receives a reply from the contractor within 30 calendar days after sending the notice of proposed debarment, the SDC in conjunction with the cognizant contracting officer shall consider the information in the reply before the SDC makes their recommendation to the SDO.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The SDO reviews submittals and case documents, and acts in accordance with DOT Order 4200.5G and the General DOT Guidelines for Suspension and Debarment, paragraph 12c.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The SDO, upon the request of the contractor proposed for debarment, shall, as soon as practicable, allow the contractor an opportunity to appear before the SDO to present information or argument, in person or through a representative. The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. This information submitted by a contractor proposed for debarment is known as a Presentation of Matters in Opposition as set forth in DOT Order 4200.5G. DOT shall conduct the proceeding in an informal manner and without requirement for a transcript. The SDO may use flexible procedures to allow a contractor to present matters in opposition via telephone or internet. If so, the debarring official should change the notice in paragraph (c) of this section to include those flexible procedures.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) If the SDO finds the contractor's or individual's submission in opposition to the proposed debarment raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment and the debarment action is not based on a conviction or civil judgment, the SDC shall submit to the SDO the information establishing the dispute of material facts. If the SDO agrees there is a genuine dispute of material facts, the SDO shall conduct a fact-finding proceeding or shall refer the dispute to a designee for resolution pursuant to 1209.470. The SDC shall provide the contractor or individual the disputed material fact(s).
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) If the proposed debarment action is based on a conviction or civil judgment, or if there are no disputes over material facts, or if any disputes over material facts have been resolved pursuant to 1209.470, the SDO shall make a decision on the basis of all information available including any written findings of fact submitted by the designated fact finder, and oral or written arguments presented or submitted to the SDC by the contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Notice of debarring official's decision.</em> In actions processed under FAR 9.406 where no suspension is in place and where a fact-finding proceeding is not required, DOT shall make the final decision on the proposed debarment within 30 business days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the contractor by the means of delivery set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, unless the SDO extends this period for good cause.
