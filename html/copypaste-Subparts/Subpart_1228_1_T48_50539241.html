         <p class="p List2">(2) On construction contracts exceeding $2,000, if the contracting officer is informed (through routine compliance checking, a complaint, or a request for information) that a laborer, mechanic, apprentice, trainee, watchman, or guard employed by the contractor or subcontractor at any tier may have been paid wages less than those required by the applicable labor standards provisions of the contract, the contracting officer shall promptly initiate an investigation in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR subpart 22.4, irrespective of the employee's rights under the Miller Act. When an employee's request for information is involved, the contracting officer shall inform the inquirer that such investigation will be made. To insure proper payment to such employees, this investigation is required pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3141), and Copeland (Anti-Kickback) Act (41 U.S.C. 51-58).

The contracting officer furnishing the copies shall place the statement “Certified to be a true and correct copy” followed by his/her signature, title and name of the OA. The fee for furnishing the requested certified copies shall be determined in accordance with the DOT Freedom of Information Act regulation, 49 CFR part 7, (TAR) 48 CFR 1224.203).

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The Miller Act's requirement that certain contracts have payment bonds in place in order to protect the public, including the Government, material, men and laborers is not generally necessary with respect to the classes of contracts described under (TAR) 48 CFR 1228.106-7100(a). Inasmuch as the Government would directly or indirectly bear the burden of premiums for performance and payment bonds obtained in connection with such contracts, a substantial savings can be made by waiving the requirement that they be obtained. However, unusual circumstances may arise in which either payment or performance bonds, or both, will be advantageous in connection with certain such contracts.
