         <p class="p List2">(2) For other matters, pursuant to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADRA), DOT has appointed a Dispute Resolution Specialist, who is responsible for the operations of the Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution.

Alternative means of dispute resolution include settlement negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, fact-finding, mini-trials, and arbitration, or any combination of these methods. The Center may also arrange for an external public or private neutral at the parties' expense.
