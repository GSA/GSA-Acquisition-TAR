OA regulations may be more restrictive or require higher approval levels than those permitted by (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 unless otherwise specified.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(2) <em class="ph i">Acquisition procedures.</em> The SPE is the individual who issues or authorizes the issuance of internal agency guidance at any organizational level. DOT internal operating procedures are contained in the Transportation Acquisition Manual (TAM). OA procedures necessary to implement or supplement the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1, (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12, or TAM may be issued by the Head of the Contracting Agency (HCA), who may delegate this authority to any organizational level deemed appropriate. OA procedures may be more restrictive or require higher approval levels than those permitted by the TAM unless otherwise specified.
